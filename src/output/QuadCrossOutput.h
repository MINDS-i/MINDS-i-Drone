/*
Solves a 4x4 linear system
    the unit responses to the four inputs, which are
        0: pitch ccw+
        1: roll ccw+
        2: z ccw+
        3: total percentage output force
        equations in the x-y-z = North-East-Down frame
    The output is of the form:
        0: front right motor (ccw)
        1: back left motor   (ccw)
        1: front left motor  (cw)
        2: back right motor  (cw)

The input and output arrays can be equal

The file is based on a plus flying configuration - The characteristic matrix:

         #0 #1 #2 #3
model = [ 1 -1  1 -1;  # pitch
         -1  1  1 -1;  # roll
          1  1 -1 -1;  # yaw
          1  1  1  1 ] # throttle

where: model*motors=torques

The solution below is build using the LU factorization because it has been
tested to be more efficient than the matrix inverse
